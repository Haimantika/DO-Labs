# Welcome to the DigitalOcean GenAI Platform Workshop: Recruiter AI Agent

In this workshop, we'll guide you through deploying a **Recruiter AI Agent** using DigitalOcean's GenAI Platform. The goal is to create a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** that can assist with recruitment tasks like candidate screening, interview preparation, talent acquisition, and hiring process optimization.

This hands-on session will demonstrate how to integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to build an intelligent agent designed specifically for recruitment and talent acquisition.

## Why Build a Recruiter AI Agent?

Managing recruitment processes can be complex, requiring knowledge of talent acquisition, compliance, interviewing techniques, and candidate assessment. An AI agent specialized in recruitment can:

- Provide instant guidance on hiring best practices
- Help create effective job descriptions and screening criteria
- Automate repetitive recruitment tasks
- Serve as a knowledge base for recruitment best practices

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a fully functional Recruiter AI Agent deployed on DigitalOcean's GenAI platform.

## Workshop Goals

- Deploy a GenAI Agent tailored for recruitment management
- Utilize DigitalOcean's GenAI infrastructure to deploy, test, and scale your agent

Optionally, you can also modify this AI Agent to include:

- Your organization's hiring guidelines and best practices
- Any operational procedures for managing recruitment in your organization

## Resources for Recruitment
